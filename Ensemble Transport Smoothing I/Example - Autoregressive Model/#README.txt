To reproduce the results reported in the manuscript, first run the files "run_AR_process.py" and "run_AR_process_cubic.py" to generate the output files.

WARNING: These files will take quite a while to generate. You can reduce this computational costs by reducing the "repeats" integer from the default 1,000.

The varying Python files beginning with "plot_" can then be used to generate the figures in the manuscript.
